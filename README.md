## 0 (Prelab) Software Setup

Estimated time of completion: 15 min

Before coming in to lab, please download and install the following software.

### 0.1 Python 

1. Download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Make sure to check "Add python.exe to PATH".

</p>

3. Click "Install Now" and finish the installation.

    <summary><i> FAQs </i></summary>

    - **What version of Python do I need?**  
    We recommend at least 3.8 to ensure compatibility with the packages we will use in this class. If you already have Python, you should be able to check its version by entering the command `python --version` in your terminal. 

    - **How do I check that I installed Python correctly?**  
    Entering the command `python` in your terminal should return `Python X.X (tags...`. If it instead returns `python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file` or `python: command not found`, you may have forgotten to add Python to PATH during installation. You can fix this using the following instructions: [How to Add Python to PATH](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/).

    - **I already have Miniconda/Anaconda Python. Do I need to get vanilla Python?**  
    We recommend getting vanilla Python. The staff may not be able to help troubleshoot issues relating to `conda`.

### 0.2 UR5 RTDE

Install `ur_rtde`:
- Linux/Mac: 
  - Open terminal and type `pip3 install ur_rtde`
- Windows: 
  - Install wsl 
  - Open terminal and type `pip3 install ur_rtde`

## 1 Motor Modelling and Controller Design

Estimated time of completion: 20 min

Clone this repository. Open `matlab/MotorModel.mlx` in MATLAB and follow along the guided tutorial to find the nominal controller gains for the motors.

## 2 Validate Hardware Setup
Estimated time of completion: 10 min

Like in the previous labs, we first want to make sure the parts work individually! Faulty wiring or hardware can be very difficult to debug in complex systems.

### 2.1 Validate Microcontroller

**Make sure that motor power is turned off any time you are uploading code to your microcontroller.** The arm has a tendency to spin around and hit itself if motor power is on during upload. As a reminder, motor power should only be on when you expect the motors to move. Otherwise, please keep motor power off. 

<details> <summary> <i> How to know if the motor power is on? </i> </summary>

The yellow LED on the motor driver indicates whether motor power is on or off.
</details>

Clone this repository and run `robot/blink_test.cpp`. You should see the onboard LED change colors! 

<details> <summary> <i> Forget how to clone? </i> </summary>

Please refer to the [instructions from Lab 1](
https://github.com/mit212/lab1_2024?tab=readme-ov-file#31-git-clone).

### 2.2 Validate Motors

Orient the arm straight up, in default starting position. Run `test_code/motor_drive_test.cpp` to validate your motor setup. You should see both motors oscillating back and forth. Remember, motor 1 is attached to the base and motor 2 is attached to the second link. 

### 2.3 Validate Encoders

Run `test_code/encoder_test.cpp` to validate your encoder setup. Open the Serial Monitor to see the output and confirm that both the direction and the magnitude make sense!

### 2.4 Validate Joystick

Run `test_code/joystick_test.cpp` to validate your joystick setup. You should be able to see joystick readings within the range `[-1, 1]`.

## 3 Tune Controller
Estimated time of completion: 20 min

We will be using `lab_code/sinusoidal_input.cpp` to tune our controllers. We will tune the two motors separately.

1. Uncomment `#define MOTOR2` and comment out `#define MOTOR1`.
2. Update the parameters under the `#ifdef MOTOR1` section to be the nominal parameters computed from MATLAB. 
3. Run `lab_code/sinusoidal_input.cpp`.
4. Open `matlab/TuningPlot.m` in MATLAB. Update the COM port.
5. Run `matlab/TuningPlot.m` in MATLAB to visualize the performance of your controller. 
6. Tune your controller by incrementally changing `Ti1`, `Td1`, `Kp1`, and `alpha1` and seeing how that affects performance. Ideally, we want minimal overshoot, oscillations, and steady state error. 
7. Once you are satisfied with the performance, repeat the process for `MOTOR2`. 

## 4 Drawing Revisited
Estimated time of completion: 10 min

We will now use your tuned controllers to improve the drawing from last lab!

1. Open `lab_code/drawing.cpp` and update the parameters.
2. Set `trajectoryType = HORIZONTAL_LINE`.
3. Run `lab_code/drawing.cpp` and observe whether the arm performs better than last lab.
4. Open `matlab/TrajectoryPlot.m` in MATLAB. Update the COM port.
5. Run `matlab/TrajectoryPlot.m` to visualize the target and actual trajectories.
6. Set `trajectoryType = JOYSTICK` and run `lab_code/drawing.cpp` again.
7. Draw something awesome using your joystick!

## X Optional

Here are some optional challenges you can try if you finish lab early!
1. Run `lab_code/drawing.cpp` with `trajectoryType = VERTICAL_LINE`.
2. Run `lab_code/drawing.cpp` with `trajectoryType = CIRCLE`.
3. Connect the joystick to a separate microcontroller and make it wireless.
4. Try using another type of input besides the joystick. For example, you can use potentiometers or an IMU!
